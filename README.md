Dress by weather

This application is primarily to predict the weather of your city for the next 5 days and helps you make a quicker wardrobe decision. 

-The application is built on Javascript and nodejs for the backend. 

-I have used an existing free template and built on it and Yahoo Weather API for the data. 

-The codebase is in the gh-pages branch as I have used Github pages for hosting the project.

The demo can be found at http://hackerpack.me/Climate-Chic/
